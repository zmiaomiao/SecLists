<P>
Welcome to Answering Islam!
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your interest in our information. 
<P>
If you reached this particular page on our server, it means 
usually that the file name (URL, web page address) was not 
spelled corrrectly.
<P>
Most of these errors occur, because there is a lower case 
character where an upper case should be. For example, if 
the page you wanted to reach was
<P>
<DIR>http://answering-islam.org/Books/Muir/index.htm</DIR>
<P>
but you followed a link that spelled the address of this 
page as 
<P>
<DIR>http://answering-islam.org/books/muir/index.htm</DIR>
<P>
you will get this <b>Error 404 : File not found</b> message.
<P>
For most of our web page addresses we follow the rule that
directory names begin with an upper case letter, while the
file names are in lower case only. Please retry after 
correcting the address according to this rule. We hardly 
ever remove or relocate pages on our web site.
<P>
<DIR><font size="-1">There is one exception to the last statement. 
We recently moved the complete folders of some of our authors, 
i.e. the individual file names remained the same:</font>
<p>
<pre>
<b>Old folder location</b>                        <b>New folder location</b>

<pre></DIR>

<P>
Our file names may have the extension ".htm" or ".html", 
so that you could try also the other extension alternative 
to see whether that works.
<P>
If all of these suggested attempts to correct the address 
still lead you to this error page, take away the last part of 
the address (the individual parts are separated by "/") and retry. 
If this does not help you to locate the desired page, 
feel free to <A HREF="/dialog.html">contact us</A>. 
You may also utilize our <A HREF="/search.html">search page</A>.
<P>
If you came to this page following a link from another web 
site, please tell the webmaster of that web site that their
link is not correct. Thank you very much.
