<A NAME = "why"><H4 ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="quote.gif" ALT="quotemark" BORDER="0">Somebody asked me why I'm giving away the store. Why do I devote a web site, books, and online columns to teaching others how to use techniques that took me years to develop? Aren't I worried about competition?<P>
Short, wise-guy answer: I have no competition.<P>
Real answer: Payback time. I've had some great mentors along the way, and want to pass their gifts along. Laurence <a href="http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/results/?id=2270" title="His wife. I couldn't find a web reference directly to him." target="_blank">Holcolmb</a>, former head of continuity at NBC and professor at Emerson College, taught me how every word -- and by extension, every tiny sound -- counts.  <a href="http://www.tonyschwartz.org/" target="_blank">Tony Schwartz</a>, who practically invented the field of broadcast sound design, gave me tips and encouragement when I was starting out. Wavy Gravy -- you've  <I>got </I>to know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavy_Gravy" target="_blank">who he is</a> -- taught me it's okay to be dangerous if you know who you are. And legendary Boston ad men <a href="stub" target="blank" title="do you know how to find him?">John Dowd Jr</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Copywriter-Life-Making-Other-Mistakes/dp/0970047649/" target="_blank">Ray Welch</a> taught me how important it is to make a game out of your work... but don't trust anyone else to count the cards.<P>
Besides, I'm not worried about competition. It forces me to keep trying new things.<IMG SRC="closequote.gif" ALT="quotemark" ALIGN=TEXTTOP WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="19" BORDER="0"></H4>
