<li><span class="tdTopic">I am having technical problems.</span>
<p>
There may be a local connectivity problem &mdash; try opening www.google.co.uk or www.microsoft.com &mdash; if you have problems with these websites it is likely you are not connected to the internet.&nbsp;
Many problems are solved if you simply close and reopen your browser or clear your browser cache.&nbsp;
In more serious cases you may need to reboot your device.
</p>
<p>  
If you are using a workplace connection and have poor network performance or permission issues please contact your local technical resources.
</p>
<p> 
This site should support most common browsers including all recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari &amp; Opera.&nbsp;
If you encounter any difficulties with these or any other browsers please send a report to the email address below. 
</p>
<p> 
The site is optimised to work with most common mobile devices.&nbsp;
If you experience any difficulties while using a smartphone or tablet to access the site please try from another device or send a report to the email address below. 
</p>
<p> 
Lotus Notes users may experience problems if using the internal browser provided with Lotus Notes;&nbsp;
to work round this, please set the Web Browser option in your Location Preferences to use the default for your operating system.
</p></li>
<li><span class="tdTopic">The internet system won&rsquo;t accept my Security Code.</span>
<p>
Make sure you are entering it correctly; there are 6 or 8 characters for &lsquo;Part One&rsquo; and 4 characters for &lsquo;Part Two&rsquo;.&nbsp;
These must be entered without spaces into the appropriate textboxes.&nbsp;
Your Security Code may have been prepopulated for you by a unique link contained in your email.
</p></li>
<li><span class="tdTopic">
The internet system says I&rsquo;ve already voted.</span>
<p>
Once you have clicked the Submit button to confirm your vote, you cannot come back later to change your vote and the system will prevent anyone from logging in again using the same Security Code. 
</p></li>
<li><span class="tdTopic">
I encountered an error OR my internet connection was interrupted during voting, has my vote been recorded?</span>
<p>
Try logging in again, if the vote was recorded properly the system will prevent you from voting again;&nbsp;
if the vote was not recorded, the system will allow you to log in.
</p></li>
<li><span class="tdTopic">
I cannot find the Vote By Internet website that I am searching for.</span>
<p>
Due to the temporary nature of our Vote By Internet websites they do not typically appear in internet search results such as Google, Yahoo or Bing.&nbsp;
Typing the website address into the address bar of your browser will take you directly to the log-in page.&nbsp;
If you received your voting instructions by email then the email will usually contain a hyperlink to the website that can be opened. 
</p></li>
<li><span class="tdTopic">
I am a visually impaired or disabled internet user and require special software or tools to browse the internet.&nbsp;
  Is the website compatible with my system?</span>
<p>
We have tested the website on a wide range of different browsers, and incorporated principles of accessibility into the website design wherever possible without compromising the required functionality and security.&nbsp;
Thus we have tried to make the website as usable and accessible as possible, but please let us know if you encounter problems and we will investigate them.
</p></li>
<li><span class="tdTopic">
There is a document on the website that I cannot open.</span>
<p>
To open any PDF documents on the website you will need to have Adobe Reader installed, it can be downloaded for free from the <a href="http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/" target="_blank" >Adobe website</a>.
</p></li>
