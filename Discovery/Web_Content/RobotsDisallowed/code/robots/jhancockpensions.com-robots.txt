<!--This comment was added to pad the size of this redirect file. IE has an issue when this file
is less than 512 bytes. IE has a built in default 404 handler page. If this page is less than
512 bytes and 404 handler setting on IIS is of type FILE, then IE's default 404 handler is displayed
to the user. So, this comment has been added to increase the size of this redirect file to be greater
than 512 bytes. -->
