If Nestgame.net is able to charge your Payment Card (existing or new, if you have provided new Payment Card information,) during the nine (9) -day period and any past due Nestgame.net Online Monthly Package fees are paid, then Nestgame.net Online benefits will continue uninterrupted and this Payment Card will be used to charge the applicable periodic monthly package fee for each consecutive renewal period until your Nestgame.net Online Monthly Package is cancelled (your original anniversary date will still apply). If Nestgame.net is unable to charge your Payment Card (existing or new, if you have provided new Payment Card Information), within the nine (9) -day period, then your Nestgame.net Online Monthly Package will be indefinitely suspended beginning on the tenth (10th) day from the date your Payment Card was initially declined. For the thirty (30) days immediately following the suspension day, Nestgame.net may attempt to charge the Payment Card the periodic monthly package fee every ten (10) days. If the charge is accepted, then your Nestgame.net Online benefits will be reinstated as of the date the charge is accepted. This charge date now becomes your new periodic anniversary date and the Payment Card will be used to charge the applicable periodic monthly package fee for each consecutive renewal period until your Nestgame.net Online Monthly Package is canceled and will be your Payment Card for all purposes.</p><p><strong>Cancellation by You. </strong><br />The initial periodic Nestgame.net Online Monthly Package fee is valid for an initial package period starting on the date your paid monthly package begins and continuing through the periodic anniversary date. For example, if you are on a free trial monthly package and your free trial expires on June 17 and your paid Nestgame.net Online Monthly Package begins on June 18, your initial monthly package fee entitles you to Nestgame.net Online benefits until July 18 and your Payment Method will be charged on July 18 (the anniversary date) for the period of July 19 through August 18. You can cancel your Nestgame.net Online Monthly Package at any time and you will not be charged for any additional renewals. For example, if your anniversary date is the 5th of each month and you cancel your Nestgame.net Online Monthly Package on Oct. 20, then you will not be charged on Nov. 5 (for the Nov. 6 - Dec. 5 period) and your Nestgame.net Online Monthly Package Term will terminate on Nov. 5.
