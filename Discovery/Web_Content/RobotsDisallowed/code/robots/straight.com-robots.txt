# Googlebot is crawling googletag.defineSlot('/1025923/<name of slot>')
# and assuming it is a URL and tries to index it. Wrapping it in

# DFP contrib module from previous build did not use a leading forward
# slash and would look like this "1025923/<name of slot>", however,
# this is not how Google's documentation uses it.
