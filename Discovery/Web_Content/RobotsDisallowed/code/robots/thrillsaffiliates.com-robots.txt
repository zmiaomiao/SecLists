        </ol>
        <h3>7. Payment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><span>7.1</span>   The Company agrees to pay the Affiliate the Commission. The Commission shall be deemed to be inclusive of value added tax or any other applicable tax.</li>
          <li><span>7.2</span>   The Commission is calculated at the end of each month and payments shall be made by the 5th-10th of the following calendar month, provided that the amount due exceeds &euro;50 (the &ldquo;Minimum Threshold&rdquo;). If the balance due is less than the Minimum Threshold, it shall be accumulated and carried over to the following month and shall be payable when the total Commissions collectively exceeds the Minimum Threshold.</li>
          <li><span>7.3</span>   Payment of Commissions shall be made in accordance with the payment method chosen by the Affiliate in the Affiliate Application. If an error is made in the calculation of the Commission, the Company reserves the right to correct such calculation at any time and will immediately pay out underpayment or reclaim overpayment made to the Affiliate.</li>
          <li><span>7.4</span>   The Affiliate&rsquo;s acceptance of the payment of the Commission shall be deemed to constitute the full and final settlement of the balance due for the relevant period.</li>
          <li><span>7.5</span>   If the Affiliate disagrees with the balance due as reported, it shall notify the Company within thirty (30) days and state the reasons of the disagreement. Failure to notify the Company within the prescribed time limit shall be deemed to be considered as an irrevocable acknowledgment of the balance due for the period indicated.</li>
          <li><span>7.6</span>   The Company may in its sole discretion withhold the payment of any balance to the Affiliate for up to one hundred-and-eighty (180) days if the Company needs to investigate and verify that the relevant transactions comply with the provisions of the Agreement.</li>
          <li><span>7.7</span>   No payment shall be due if the Company has reasons to believe that the traffic generated by the Affiliate is illegal or is in breach of any of the provisions of the Agreement.</li>
          <li><span>7.8</span>   The Affiliate agrees to return all Commissions received based on fraudulent or falsified transactions and indemnify the Company for all costs and losses incurred in relation to such transactions (including, but without limitation, legal fees and costs).</li>
          <li><span>7.9</span>   The Company reserves the right to set limits for a minimum level of activity on Affiliate&rsquo;s accounts. Such minimum activity levels will be continuously reviewed and the Company reserves the right to terminate any agreement not reaching the limit. Such limit shall not be unreasonably high and basically reflect the intention of avoiding accounts where the revenue does not cover the Company&rsquo;s internal costs for maintaining the account and the payout procedure.</li>
          <li><span>7.10</span>   The Affiliate may, at the sole discretion of the Company, be provided with the opportunity to restructure its commission structure.&nbsp; Examples of alternative commission structures could include a Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) Module.&nbsp; However, and for the avoidance of doubt, only one type of commission structure for the same product may be applied at the same time.&nbsp; Therefore, once an Affiliate accepts the Company&rsquo;s offer to apply a new commission structure, different to the standard Commission Structure detailed in this Agreement, the Affiliate hereby agrees and understands that the new proposed commission structure shall replace his existing commission structure in its entirety. Notwithstanding the above, the Affiliate&rsquo;s obligations assumed under this Agreement will still continue to apply to the Affiliate even if a new commission structure is applicable.</li>
          <li><span>7.11</span>   The Affiliate shall have the sole responsibility to pay any and all taxes, levies, fees, charges and any other money payable or due both locally and abroad (if any) to any tax authority, department or other competent entity as a result of the compensation generated under this Agreement.&nbsp;The Company shall under no circumstances whatsoever be held liable for any such amounts unpaid but found to be due by the Affiliate and the Affiliate shall indemnify the Company in that regard.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>8. Affiliate Website(s) and the Links</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><span>8.1</span>   The Affiliate expressly acknowledges and agrees that the use of the Internet and the Affiliate Program is at the Affiliate&rsquo;s own risk. The Company makes no guarantee in relation to the accessibility of the Operator Websites at any particular time or any particular location. The Company shall in no event be liable to the Affiliate or anyone else for any inaccuracy, error or omission in, or loss, injury or damage caused in whole or in part by failures, delays or interruptions of, the Operator Websites or the Affiliate Program.</li>
          <li><span>8.2</span>   During the term of this Agreement, the Links shall be prominently displayed on the Affiliate Website(s) in accordance with what is agreed between the Company and the Affiliate.</li>
          <li><span>8.3</span>   The Company has the right to monitor the Affiliate Website(s) in order to ensure the Affiliate&rsquo;s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Affiliate shall provide the Company with all data reasonably requested in order to perform such monitoring.</li>
          <li><span>8.4</span>   The Affiliate shall not register or purchase domain names, keywords, search terms or other identifiers for use in advertising or search or referral services which are similar or identical with the trademarks of the BetIt Group or which include the word &ldquo;Thrills&rdquo; or variations thereof.</li>
          <li><span>8.5</span>   The Affiliate shall not take any action which could cause any confusion as to the Company&rsquo;s or the Operator Websites&rsquo; relationship with the Affiliate and the Affiliate Website(s).</li>
          <li><span>8.6</span>   The Affiliate shall at all times comply with the Maltese Data Protection Act (as applicable from time to time), the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 and any other similar legislation. For example, the Affiliate shall always inform its users that tracking technology will be installed on the users hard drive when the user clicks on the Links and provide the user with an option to reject such installation.</li>
