# Bots won't visit the links below but they will index them so they can still
# show up in search results albeit without snippets or cache (and probably at
# fairly low rank).  For google we could use the Noindex: directive instead of
# disallow, though that's experimental.  That'll force pages out very quickly
# so need to be very careful with that...

# The matched string is prefix so /help blocks /help.html and /help/foo
# So if disallowing an action avoid the trailing slash when there's no conflict
# to avoid parameter/route changes breaking the match.

# Note you can have multiple sitemaps listed in robots.txt and across domains
# too. Everything is valid across domains/subdomains to an organic crawler iff
# for sitemap A on host B that contains a url on host C the robots.txt file
# on host C point to sitemap A on host B. Submitted sitemaps must generally
# only contain urls that match the site they are on.  We split our sitemaps
# by sub-domain so we can still submit them separately, but list them all here
# so that they are easy to find oganically too (much like if they were all
# combined into one).
