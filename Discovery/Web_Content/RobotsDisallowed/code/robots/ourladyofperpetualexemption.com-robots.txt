                    It is I, Megareverend and C.E.O. of Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption Church, Pastor John Oliver.
                    <br />
                    <br /> We thank you for all your kind donations, but I’m sorry to report that we have closed down the church.
                    And let me take a moment to explain why - it’s certainly not because we have to.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We have still, miraculously, not broken any laws by
                    promising you untold riches in return for sending
                    us money. We’re also not closing down because you
                    all kept sending us actual seeds, even though we
                    explicitly told you not to. We’re closing because
                    multiple people sent us sperm through the mail.
                    And when someone sends you jizz through the mail,
                    it’s time to stop whatever you’re doing.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    So we are shutting this s**t down. Praise be! <br/>

                    <br /> <br />
                    P.S. All previous monetary donations have been forwarded
                    to Doctors Without Borders. We did not send the sperm.
