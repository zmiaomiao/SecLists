[65] => Keep your Private informations safe
[70] => We are doing our best to ensure maximum safety to our clients. Our website is strongly protected against DDoS, hackers and other known or perspective threats. However, your safety also greatly depends on what you do, so follow a few simple rules to stay protected at all times: don't disclose your login data to anyone; change your passwords regularly; ignore e-mail messages asking you to login on our website - we never ask you to provide your credentials to us.
[71] => Here's what we are doing to
[72] => keep your account safe:
[73] => Strong protection against hacker and DDoS attacks
[74] => Reliable SSL-connection which encrypts your data before they are sent to our server
[75] => Highly efficient software with outstanding protection against SQL and PHP injections as well as other threats which are usually used to hack websites
[76] => Quick support service ready to help you in any situations
[77] => Pick a strong password and never share it with anyone else. Use a combination of at least six numbers, letters, and punctuation marks (like ! and &amp;).
[78] => Use our extra security features.
[79] => Make sure your email account(s) are secure
[80] => Log out of your acount when you use a computer you share with other people. If you forget, you can log out remotely.
[81] => Run anti-virus software on your computer.
[82] => Think before you click or download anything.
[83] => What can I do to
[84] => keep my accunt secure?
[85] => Pick a strong password and never share it with anyone else. Use a combination of numbers, letters, and punctuation marks (like ! and &amp;). Never use a password which is easy to guess. Remember that most security failures occur due to weak passwords like your username or easy phrases (for example, 'letmeein'). Don't forget to put down your password and hold it in a secure place which only you may access.
[86] => If you receive a letter from our website which addresses you NOT by name (e. g. &quot;Dear user&quot; or &quot;Dear member&quot;) or contains any reason for you to log into your accout immediately (e. g. &quot;Please log into your account now or it will be suspended&quot;), NEVER do so! Physhers usually send such letters with links to their own websites (they always look similar to the original website), but contain special programs which remember your login and password when you type them in.
[87] => Use anti-virus software to protect your computer and traffic from malware. Remember that viruses can destroy data on you computer, block internet connection, send out tons of spam from your IP address and even harm your computer. Most good antivirus programs are not free, however, they are cheap enough to be affordable to anyone and security is worth the price. Never click links or download programs which may be unsafe.
