Each of the thirteen 22-minute episodes will be chock-full of high-flying action-comedy with its own self-contained story, allowing children to jump in at any point. We have also developed an emotional and twist-filled narrative spanning the overall season, allowing for a rich and imaginative world where children will want to return to see how the greater story unfolds, similar to the Harry Potter and the Star Wars franchises. Our hope is for this season to play as an important part of an on-going saga following Sensei Wu and the four Ninja on their quest to stop Lord Garmadon from possessing the Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu to re-create Ninjago in his own evil image. In the last season, they've acquired the Spinjitzu weapons to protect, but now they must master their elemental powers and discover their own personal destiny, all the while a mysterious and ancient foe gets unleashed on Ninjago - the Serpentines!
