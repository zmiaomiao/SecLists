	  <h4><div class="din-bold">Program Details</div></h4>
	  
	  	<p><strong>How does the Alamo Victory Program work?</strong><br> 
		The Alamo Victory Program is a free rewards program to show our appreciation for what you are already doing----coming to the Alamo! Just use your Alamo Victory Program number every time you visit or purchase a ticket online. We’ll do our best to surprise you with discounted tickets and food & beverage offers, as well as invitations to sneak previews of new releases, exclusive screenings, T-shirts, DVDs and more! Plus, we’ll give you a free movie ticket on your birthday. It’s our way of saying thanks for choosing us.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Is the Alamo Victory Program free?</strong><br> 
		Yes, the Alamo Victory Program is an absolutely free rewards program. Plus, we give you a free movie ticket on your birthday!</p>

	  	<p><strong>Do I need to keep track of points/purchases or remember to bring a card?</strong><br> 
		The Alamo Victory Program was designed to be as easy as possible. There are no cards or points to keep track of. All you have to do to keep the surprise rewards coming is log in to Victory every time you purchase online, or tell the box office attendant every time you buy a ticket at the theater.</p>	

	  	<p><strong>I bought 4 tickets and my account was only credited with 1 visit. Is that correct?</strong><br> 
		Yes, it is. Each time you buy a movie ticket for a unique showtime (movie, time and day), the Alamo Victory Program registers one visit for your Victory Program number, regardless of the number of tickets you purchase. Here are some examples:<br>
(2) tickets to ‘Iron Man’ at 3PM + (2) tickets to ‘The Big Lebowski’ at 8PM = 2 visits</br>
(5) tickets to ‘Caveman’ at 5PM = 1 visit<br>
(3) tickets to ‘The Goonies’ at 12PM = 1 visit
</p>

	  	<p><strong>I bought 2 tickets at the box office and they don’t appear in my Online Movie Purchases history. Why do they not show?</strong><br> 
		At this time, only purchases made online through the drafthouse.com website, Facebook Connect, or  your smartphone will appear in your Online Movie Purchases history. Purchases made at the box office will not show in your Online Movie Purchases history, but you will still receive ‘visit’ credit for having seen those movies within our Victory Program.</p>
		<p>Tickets purchased through Fandango will neither show in your Online Movie Purchases history nor have the ability to be tracked by our Victory Program. We hope to improve this functionality in the near future!
</p>

	  	<p><strong>Why did my visit history change on the first of the month?</strong><br> 
		The Alamo Victory Program records your visits and updates your balances in real time. In addition, on the first of each month, your visit balance is reviewed. Any visits over 12 months will expire and be removed from your history. This does not affect your lifetime visits total.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Are gift card purchases and theater rentals eligible for earning Alamo Victory Program rewards?</strong><br> 
		No. Gift card purchases and theater rentals do not earn Alamo Victory Program rewards at this time.</p>

	  	<p><strong>What kind of rewards can I expect?</strong><br> 
		By signing up for the Alamo Victory Program, you may be surprised with special discounted tickets and food & beverage offers, as well as invitations to sneak previews of new releases, exclusive screenings, T-shirts, DVDs and more! Plus, we’ll give you a free movie ticket on your birthday.</p>

	  	<p><strong>How do I know when I am entitled to a reward?</strong><br> 
		Our box office staff will inform you of any surprise rewards you have when you pick up your tickets or you can review your rewards online by visiting drafthouse.com and signing in to your account.</p>

	  	<p><strong>How do I redeem my rewards?</strong><br> 
		<strong>Discount Movie Rewards</strong> can be redeemed in person at the box office or when making an online ticket purchase.</p>
		<p><strong>Food & Beverage Rewards</strong> can only be picked up in person from the box office. Simply provide the box office attendant your Victory information (email, telephone number, name, or Victory account ID) and which of your rewards you wish to redeem. A printed voucher will be given to you which you can then redeem with your server.
</p>

	  	<p><strong>How do I redeem my free birthday ticket?</strong><br> 
		When you sign up for the Alamo Victory Program, we will ask you for your birth date. On your birthday, we will give you a free birthday ticket that is valid for up to one week following your birthday. Go to any Alamo box office, provide your Alamo Victory Program information (email, telephone number, name, or Victory account ID)  and show a valid driver’s license and you will be given your free birthday ticket.</p>

	  	<p><strong>When do I start receiving rewards?</strong><br> 
		Once you fully register for the Alamo Victory Program by completing your profile, you will be eligible to begin receiving rewards.</p>

	  	<p><strong>How do I keep track of my rewards? Do they expire?</strong><br> 
		When you become eligible for a reward, it will automatically appear on your account. You can view your rewards online by simply logging in to your Alamo Victory Program account. Each offer has an expiration date, so be sure to check how much time you have to redeem the reward.</p>

	  	<p><strong>What are the levels in the Alamo Victory Program, and how do I move from one level to another? </strong><br> 
		There are four levels -- or "ranks" -- in the program. Everyone starts at the first rank, Citizen. From there you can progress to Fighter, followed by Captain, and finally to our top rank: Commandant.  As to how to move up, we'll just say that the more you visit, the faster you’ll move up and Commandants spend A LOT of time at the movies! Also, the more you visit us, the more cool surprises you will receive. It’s our way of saying thanks for coming to the Alamo.</p>

	  	<p><strong>I visit several different Alamo locations regularly. How do I know which locations are participating in Victory? Will all locations be participating?</strong><br> 
		All Alamo locations are participating in the Alamo Victory Program and will honor your rewards everywhere, except in the rare case that you have earned a specific reward that the location you are visiting does not offer.</p>

	  <h4><div class="din-bold">Your Alamo Victory Program Account and Registration</div></h4>

	  	<p><strong>How do I sign up?</strong><br> 
		You can sign up for Victory either in person at the box office or by signing up online at drafthouse.com/victory.</p>
		<p><strong>Sign up online.</strong> Go to drafthouse.com and click the ‘Join’ link in the top right corner. A new window will appear where you can complete your profile. Once you have registered, you can make ticket purchases using your Victory account.</p>
		<p><strong>Sign up at the box office.</strong> A member of our staff will scan a unique registration number located on one of our Victory postcards. This will open a temporary account for you. Be sure to keep this postcard since you will need the registration number on the back of the postcard to complete your Victory registration. Go to the drafthouse.com/victory page and click ‘Join.’ A new window will appear where you can enter your unique registration number into the ‘Victory Registration Number’ field. From there you can complete your Victory profile and begin earning rewards! The tickets you purchased at the theater that day will count towards your visits upon completion of your profile.</p>
		<p><strong>Sign up using your smartphone.</strong> Simply visit drafthouse.com/victory using your phone’s internet browser and sign up by clicking the ‘Join’ link. If you are at the theater, you can scan the QR Code located on one of the Victory posters located in the lobby. Scanning the QR Code will take you directly to the drafthouse.com/victory page where you can sign up.
</p>

	  	<p><strong>Am I able to access my Alamo Victory Program account on a smartphone?</strong><br> 
		Yes. You can easily access your account on your smartphone by visiting drafthouse.com/victory and entering your login name and password.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Why do you need my phone number?</strong><br> 
		Your phone number gives us a quick and easy way of uniquely identifying you at the theater. Plus, we figure it’s an easy number for you to remember. <strong>We will never call or SMS unless you specifically sign up for SMS alerts. (SMS alerts are not currently offered by the program).  This number is only used for you to quickly login to Victory at the box office.</strong></p>

	  	<p><strong>Why do you need my email address?</strong><br> 
		Providing a valid email address allows us to send you surprise rewards and is another quick way for you to login to Victory at the box office!</p>

	  	<p><strong>Is the Alamo Victory Program cardless? I REALLY want a card. What can I do?</strong><br> 
		Yes, the Alamo Victory Program is cardless. Many of our guests told us they didn’t want another card in their wallet. But, we understand that some guests prefer cards so if you REALLY want an Alamo Victory Program card, we can provide a free card for you at the box office. If you already have an Alamo gift card, we can link this card to your Victory account free of charge. This cannot be done online. Physical cards are only available at the Alamo box office. </p>

	  	<p><strong>I lost my Alamo Victory Program membership card. How do I get a replacement card?</strong><br> 
		Visit the Alamo and a box office attendant can replace your card for free.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Can I use the ticket kiosk with the Alamo Victory Program? </strong><br> 
		Yes. If you purchase a ticket at the kiosk, you must use a Victory card to get credit for your visit. You can get a physical card from the box office attendant free of charge.  Tickets purchased online can be picked up at the kiosk without a Victory card.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Can I cancel my Alamo Victory Program membership?</strong><br> 
		If you decide for whatever reason to no longer participate in the Alamo Victory Program, you can cancel by sending your request to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#442532340420362522302c2b3137216a272b29"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="442532340420362522302c2b3137216a272b29">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">
