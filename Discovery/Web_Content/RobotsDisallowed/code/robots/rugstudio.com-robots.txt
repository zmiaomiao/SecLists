#This file allows you to control web crawlers access to specific pages on your site.  Web crawlers are 
#programs that search engines run to view and analyze your site to index the content in their search engines.
#Common crawlers include Googlebot and bingbot. These are the default rules defined for your site and include
#pages and directories that crawlers do not need access to.
